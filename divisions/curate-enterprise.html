                    <p class="testimonial-text">"As CIO of our $420 million family office, I was spending 60% of my time on investment management—manager due diligence, portfolio construction, performance reporting—when I should have been focused on tax planning, estate strategy, and family governance. Outsourcing to Q4 Life as co-CIO was transformational. They handle all alternatives evaluation (we now have positions in 18 top-tier PE/VC funds we'd never have accessed independently), rebalancing, and board reporting. Portfolio performance improved from 7.8% to 11.2% over last 5 years while I reclaimed 25 hours per week. Their 0.45% fee is a bargain."</p>

Q4 Life built a sophisticated portfolio with 40% alternatives (PE, VC, real estate, private credit) that I'd never have accessed alone—minimums are $5M-$10M per investment, which is terrifying to commit without expertise. They coordinate with my CPA on tax planning (saved $400K last year through tax-loss harvesting and strategic Roth conversions), set up 529s for my kids, and helped me launch a $10M DAF for philanthropy. Portfolio up 15% in 2023 despite market volatility. Worth every penny of the $420K annual fee."</p>
