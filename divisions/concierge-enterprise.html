                    <p class="testimonial-text">"As CEO of a $2B public company, I was traveling 180+ days/year and completely neglecting my personal life—missed my daughter's 10th birthday, forgot anniversary twice, hadn't been to doctor in 4 years. My board suggested concierge service as 'executive wellness investment.' Q4 Concierge has been transformational. My dedicated concierge (Sarah) books all travel, manages 4 properties, coordinates household staff, handles my elderly parents' needs, and plans family events. She saved me 15-20 hours weekly. Most importantly, I haven't missed a single family milestone in 3 years. Worth every penny of the $42K/month fee—I'd pay double."</p>

Q4 Concierge found me apartment, furnished it, set up utilities, hired personal chef and housekeeper, coordinated 82-game travel (hotels, cars, meals), managed ticket requests from family/friends (15-30 people per game), handled my foundation event (500 attendees), and screened all service provider NDAs. During playoffs, they coordinated 40+ family members' travel/hotels across 3 cities. I focus on basketball, they handle everything else. Can't imagine life without them."</p>

Before Q4, we had chaos: duplicate bookings, missed reservations, family members competing for vacation properties, no coordination. Q4 centralized everything. They coordinate our 8 properties, plan 12+ family events annually, manage travel for everyone, handle next-gen support (college tours, first apartments, wedding planning), and provide concierge access to all 18 members. We went from spending $180K annually across 4 different service providers with poor coordination to $35K/month ($420K annually) with Q4 and infinitely better service. Family satisfaction scores went from 6.2/10 to 9.4/10."</p>
