var txt = 'Quality of Life (QoL) : Life herself has triggered the existence of multilateral services to provide for best Quality of Life. It all starts and ends with value, or it’s a hollow. How do I know? I know through knowledge. If you’re not ready to die for the comfort of others, you’re not ready to live off it either. If you’re not ready to work for humanity, you’re not ready to eat from humanity. If quality isn’t the king, quantity isn’t!!! Money= Value!!! A powerful man is a man who motivates people to be passionate about the right thing. You never wait for failure, you work for success, you get to conduct the right number of transactions beyond the numbers. Professionalism leads to increased output; spend time doing only what you’re good at and nothing else. Let others help you: letting those who’re professionals help you is part of the money=value sustainable model, to encourage and enable quality of life, both for you and for all. Perfection is when this happens in every bit of a thing. For example; do not move into a new house and set up the kitchen utilities  all by yourself: have someone else in a home essentials utility company help you; the service industry must be lived not talked about: quality must be an obligation to settle for, offer, or acquire, not an option , for the better-best quality of life. Professional Service has become an end to end requirement for better-best quality of life; professionalism not offered is one not received. Real business entities are not interested in clients buying but affording quality of life; at Q4Life, every client affords that life by offering one. Necessity outlives possibility. The only one afraid to loose is a looser...(Robert kiyosaki) Either your future stands real to you or unreal! Human depravity is the absence of value, and value is not something you create, it is something you are: so until you become that thing, you’re not ready to make money off it!! You don’t need a market because markets naturally exist by human needs; and human needs are insatiate. Allowing those who are passionate to exclusively provide services would lead to the wellbeing of everyone. Everyone in the serving business and the world at your service! Anyone doing anything they’re not passionate about isn’t given to improvement. A small valuable thing is always going to experience mustard seed exponential growth!! Those who don’t have skills to meet needs create more complex needs that cannot be met, and imbalances in the socio-economic development process. No productivity eventually becomes a problem in the production or productivity process. Do not ask the question, answer it! If you’re still asking the “how” question, you’re not a service provider. If the society and the world is going to change, we’ll have to identify the needs slice by piece; as an accountable way of fulfilling these needs. The needs of the world not fulfilled is the underdevelopment of the world! Money caught in your possession without corresponding value is a generational anomaly. Responsible reception of service is responsible provision of service; such a participation is widely considered as one of the most important concepts of modern development theory. The reality of your future is your choice through creation. The answer you have to the client’s question is what makes you a service provider, so quit asking the question; A true service is a service that doesn’t wait for a need to arise! Business isn’t created for survival, but for quality of life.'; /* The text */
