                    <p class="testimonial-text">"We had 450 engineers who needed to upskill in cloud technologies (AWS, Azure) to support our digital transformation. Q4 Capabilities designed a custom 6-month blended learning program combining online modules, hands-on labs, and certification prep. 92% of participants earned at least one cloud certification (vs. industry average of 65%), and we promoted 78 engineers to senior/lead roles they wouldn't have been ready for otherwise. The program paid for itself in 8 months through reduced contractor spend—we previously relied on $180/hour AWS consultants, now we have internal expertise. ROI was 340% in year one when accounting for promotions, retention, and contractor savings."</p>

Q4 created a Section 508-accessible online program with interactive scenarios, role-based modules, and automated compliance tracking. They integrated seamlessly with our existing LearningForce LMS and handled all the procurement paperwork (GSA Schedule made it easy). We achieved 98.7% completion in 10 months—ahead of schedule—and scored 'exemplary' on our annual cybersecurity audit.

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"I was a high school teacher earning $52K after 8 years, burned out and looking for a career change but couldn't afford to quit my job or pay $15K upfront for a bootcamp. Q4's Income Share Agreement meant I paid nothing until I landed a tech job earning over $50K. The 24-week full-stack program was intense—nights and weekends while teaching full-time—but the curriculum was practical and the career services were exceptional. Within 4 weeks of graduation, I had 3 job offers. I accepted a mid-level developer role at $95K (83% raise). I'm paying 17% of my salary for 24 months (total $38.7K on a $14.5K program), which feels fair given they took 100% of the risk and transformed my career. Now 14 months in, earning $105K after first raise, and couldn't be happier."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"I was promoted from VP of Sales to Chief Revenue Officer after our previous CRO departed unexpectedly. I'd been successful running a 45-person sales org, but suddenly I was responsible for sales, marketing, customer success, and revenue operations—280 people and $180M P&L. Q4's Executive Leadership Program was transformative. The cohort model (12 C-suite peers from non-competing companies) provided incredible peer learning, and my executive coach helped me navigate the first 100 days. The strategic thinking frameworks, board communication modules, and change management content were directly applicable. Six months into the role, our board cited my leadership as a key factor in our successful Series C raise ($85M). The $42K program cost was the best professional investment I've ever made."</p>
